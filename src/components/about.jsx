        <p className="bio"> Hi! My name is Moo Deng, a pygmy hippo born in a Thailand zoo. My hobbies
            include swimming, eating, sleeping, and terrorizing the zookeepers.
            I just like to reciprocate their energy as they tend to antagonize me.
            One day, I will grow up to be the size of my mama, and no one will 
            dare to mess with me.
